# Method Definition and Usage Example
In the `Method and associated function.rs` file, There are examples of defining and using methods and associated functions for structs.
All the codes in this file has been taught in the [Rust free tutorial in persian No: 11](https://blog.alihoseiny.ir/%d8%a2%d9%85%d9%88%d8%b2%d8%b4-%d8%b2%d8%a8%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%a8%d8%b1%d9%86%d8%a7%d9%85%d9%87%e2%80%8c%d9%86%d9%88%db%8c%d8%b3%db%8c-rust-%d9%82%d8%b3%d9%85%d8%aa%db%b1%db%b1-%d8%a7%d9%81%d8%b2%d9%88%d8%af%d9%86-method-%d9%88-associated-function-%d8%a8%d9%87-struct-%d9%87%d8%a7/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=Readme&utm_campaign=RustTutorial).
The concepts we have example(s) for them in this file:
- Struct creation
- Struct instantiation
- Method creation
- Method with Ownership moving
