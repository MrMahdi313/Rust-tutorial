## C Like enums
Example of C like enums and getting associated number to each variant by compiler are in the `CLike Enums.rs` file.

## C Like enums with custom values
Example of how we can change stored value of enum varients in the memory is in the `Http Status.rs` file. Explained by a simple enum representing brief version of http statuts.

## Enum with Values
Example of how storing values in the enums is in the `Enum with Values.rs` file.

## Enum with struct-like variants
The example of how we could declare enum varients like structs is in the `Struct Variants.rs` file.

## Using enums in the structs
We can use enums like fields of a struct. The example of this usage is in the `Using Enums in Structs.rs` file.
